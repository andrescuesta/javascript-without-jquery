# [JavaScript Without jQuery][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


There is no doubt that jQuery revolutionized front end coding. Not only did it simplify cross-browser JavaScript, but it also introduced new ways of doing common things: like working with the DOM or making HTTP requests. In fact, many parts of today's standard API were heavily influenced by jQuery. But we've reached a point where today's major browsers have excellent standards support, and the standards themselves have evolved to make writing code easier.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will show you that you really don't need jQuery. Follow along as he takes some existing jQuery-dependent code and converts it plain 'ol vanilla JavaScript.
